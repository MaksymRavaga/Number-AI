# Number AI

Draw a digit with your mouse — the neural network predicts what digit it is.

## Features
- Simple drawing window (Python)
- Digit recognition with a trained model
- You can train your own model from scratch

## Download
- **`Number AI.zip`** — source code + `INSTRUCTIONS.txt`

## Quick start
1. Download `Number AI.zip` from this repository
2. Extract it anywhere
3. Open `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` and follow the steps

## What’s inside the zip
- `draw_predict.py` — draw & predict
- `make_dataset.py` — create `dataset.npz`
- `train_model.py` — train model → `digit_model.keras`
- `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` — full guide

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (recommended)
- Packages: `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `pillow`

## Notes
If you only want to use the app, you just need `draw_predict.py` + `digit_model.keras`.
